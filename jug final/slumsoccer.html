<br /><br /><br /><b>SLUM SOCCER:</b><br /><br />

For over a decade now, Slum Soccer has been using the &lsquo;beautiful game&rsquo; a unique and yet, a perfect vehicle that transcends race, religion, language and gender to bring about a positive change in the lives of street dwellers, recovering drug addicts, alcoholics, children of commercial sex workers and those displaced by natural disaster. We function with the ultimate aim of reaching out to the Indian underprivileged using football as a tool for social improvement and empowerment. Slum Soccer has however always attempted to make participating individuals self-reliant in order to ensure that their rehabilitation is sustainable.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Football incorporates a lot of values applicable in any walk of life. From being social misfits, players who have participated in our programs transform into people who have the ability to work with a team and they learn to trust their team mates, picking up vital life skills like communication, leadership, gender equality, environmental awareness etc. Over the past ten years, we have functioned true to our original objective of reaching out to and developing football in the grassroots. What started as simple weekend sessions has bloomed into full-fledged football coaching camps, educational and healthcare workshops and societal development programs bringing a positive influence to the lives of nearly 80,000 men, women and children in over 63 districts all around the country.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2007, Slum Soccer has been Indian National Partners to the Homeless World Cup Foundation representing the country at the annual event. We are also part of the street football network convened by streetfootballworld (strategic alliance partner of FIFA) on whose board Slum Soccer is represented by CEO, Abhijeet Barse. Partnerships with Barclays Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, Coaches Across Continents and ONGC in India have ensured a steady influx of financial and technical support.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end result we hope for from these programs where we transfer life skills is employability. We also have in mind a program to extend our concept of sustainable rehabilitation by establishing ways to empower participating target communities and also assist in the inception of realistic and viable business ventures proposed by enterprising people. We are convinced that, that will be the easiest way to uplift communities as a whole.<br />
